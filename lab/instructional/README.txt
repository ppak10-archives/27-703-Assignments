DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
---------------------
Directory of Files:
   A. Filename:  Lock.py      
      Short description: This python script contains the image processing operations and other
operations like image rotation and calculation of the intercept length. This is written in the
form of a function to be called by Key.py.       
      
   B. Filename:  Key.py     
      Short description: This python script calls the Lock.py script and takes input for all the 
parameters such as thresholding type, filter sizes of various image processing parameters, angle
step size for rotation and image scale bar to calculate final lath thickness and give the output
in excel sheet.        
        
   C. Filename:  Instructions.txt      
      Short description: This is an basic instruction file on how to execute the python scripts and
