The following instructions are to be followed for calculating the alpha lath thickness and volume fraction in Ti64 alloys. 
Packages used in python:
1. time 
2. os
3. cv2 (this is the opencv package we will be utilizing)
4.xlswriter
5.numpy

The code was successfully executed in Spyder (python version 3.7)

Step 1: Select the directoy and place both lock and key files in the same directory.
Step 2: Run the Lock.py script
Step 3: In Key.py python script:
	3.1: Assign the path for the images (for example 'D:/test image', if my folder name is test image)
	3.2: Assign the name of the excel sheet
	3.3: Assign all the process parameters 
Step 4: Run the Key.py script 

Results will be available in the excel sheet each seperated by '~' and in the following order:
File Name~Mean Intercept length~mean Inverse intercept length~volume fraction~lath thickness

Select the first column and perform the following:
Data -> Text to columns -> Delimited -> tab and other: ~ -> General -> Finish

A parameter text file will also be available along with the few saved images containing the tuned in parameters.
